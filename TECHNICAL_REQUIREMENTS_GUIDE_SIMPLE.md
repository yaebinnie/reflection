## Quick Start

This simplified guide is for straightforward projects that don't need complex technical documentation. Use this if your project:
- Uses one or two main tools
- Doesn't require multiple APIs or services
- Has simple technical requirements
- Is a quick prototype or small project

**For more complex projects, use the full Technical Requirements Guide.**
