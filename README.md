### Project Description
This installation is a multisensory, projection based experience that uses a two way mirror, webcam, and Azure Kinect DK to track the participant’s distance and facial data such as blinking and facial expression. As the participant moves closer or farther, the system shifts through visual and auditory cycles that communicate forms of overstimulation, calm, and self confrontation. The experience focuses on spatial behavior and the emotional tension created when someone approaches or withdraws from their own reflection.

A webcam placed behind the mirror captures facial cues that influence the environment. Blinking or looking away reduces overstimulation. Facial expression changes influence intensity as well. A shift from happiness to anger increases visual and sonic pressure. Small movements create large emotional ripples in the space.

The installation examines how people react when their reflection responds in unexpected and artful ways. By treating reflection as a relational act rather than a static image, the piece invites participants to question distance, comfort, and the way overstimulation grows or settles depending on how they carry themselves.

The two way mirror provides partial privacy while allowing the interior interactions to stay layered and intimate. The goal is not to diagnose emotional states, but to offer a poetic environment where participants become more aware of how they navigate closeness, avoidance, and the pressure of being observed by their own mirrored self.
