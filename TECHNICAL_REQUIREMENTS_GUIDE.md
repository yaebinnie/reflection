## Introduction

Documenting technical requirements helps you understand what's needed to build your prototype and communicate effectively with developers or technical team members. This guide focuses specifically on technical requirements—platforms, tools, and APIs—to help you scope your prototype accurately.

What this guide covers:
- Platform requirements (where your project will run)
- Tools and software needed for development
- APIs and services your project will use
- Technical architecture considerations
- Dependencies and constraints

What this guide doesn't cover:
- User experience design
- Content creation
- Timeline and scheduling
- Budget estimation

How to use this guide:
1. Start with the Getting Started section to identify your project type
2. Work through each section that applies to your project
3. Skip sections that don't apply—this guide is flexible
4. Fill in the template prompts as you go
5. Use the Template Summary at the end to consolidate your answers


## Getting Started

Before diving into technical requirements, take a moment to identify your project basics.

### Project Identification

Project Name: `[Your project name here]`

Brief Description: `[1-2 sentences describing what your project does]`

### Project Type Selection

Choose the type that best matches your project (you can select multiple if applicable):

- [ ] Games - Interactive game experiences (often built in Unity or other game engines)
- [ ] AR (Augmented Reality) - Overlays digital content on the real world
- [ ] VR (Virtual Reality) - Fully immersive virtual environments
- [ ] Projection Mapping - Mapping visuals onto physical surfaces or objects
- [ ] Installation Art - Physical installations with interactive or immersive elements
- [ ] Data Visualization - Visual representations of data, often interactive
- [ ] Embodied Interaction - Projects that respond to body movement and physical presence
- [ ] Sound-Based Immersion - Audio-driven immersive experiences
- [ ] Simulation - Realistic or abstract simulations of systems or environments
- [ ] Visualizers - Real-time visual representations, often of audio or data
- [ ] Other: `[Describe your project type]`

> Tip: Once you've identified your project type, check the Project Type Quick Tips section (Section 8) for guidance on which sections to prioritize.


## Platform Requirements

Your platform choice determines what hardware and software capabilities you can use, what APIs are available, and how users will access your project.

### Why Platform Choice Matters

Different platforms have different:
- Performance capabilities - Processing power, graphics capabilities
- API availability - What device features you can access (camera, sensors, etc.)
- Distribution methods - How users get your project (app stores, web, etc.)
- Development requirements - What tools and environments you need

### Common Platform Options

## APIs & Services

APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) and services connect your project to external functionality, data, or cloud services.

### What Are APIs and Services?

APIs are interfaces that let your project communicate with external systems or access device features. Examples: location services, social media login, payment processing.

Third-party services are cloud-based tools that provide functionality without building it yourself. Examples: cloud storage, analytics, user authentication.

Platform-specific APIs are built into the platform itself. Examples: ARKit (iOS), ARCore (Android), WebXR (web browsers).

### When Do You Need Them?

You'll need APIs/services if your project:
- Accesses device features (camera, GPS, sensors)
- Connects to the internet (cloud storage, real-time data)
- Integrates with other services (social media, payment systems)
- Tracks usage or analytics

### Template: APIs & Services

Complex architecture = more development time and potential challenges

### Common Architecture Types

**Standalone:** Everything runs on one device, no internet required
**Client-Server:** Your project (client) communicates with a server for data or processing
**Peer-to-Peer:** Multiple instances of your project communicate directly with each other
**Hybrid:** Combination of standalone and connected features

## Dependencies & Constraints

Understanding dependencies and constraints helps identify potential blockers and compatibility issues before development starts.

### What Are Technical Dependencies?
