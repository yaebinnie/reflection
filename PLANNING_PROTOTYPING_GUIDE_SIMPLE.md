## Quick Start

This guide helps you plan and scope your project from initial concept through prototype completion. Use this if you need to:
- Break down your project into manageable phases
- Plan your timeline toward a December completion goal
- Understand what documentation is needed at each stage
- Track progress through world building, narrative, interactivity, and prototyping

For complex projects with multiple team members or extensive research requirements, consider using dedicated project management tools.

## Project Phases

### World Building

In this phase you will build your world. This applies in many different ways, depending on the type of project you have selected.

**Key Questions:**
- What does your world sound like? Is there music in your world?
- What does your world look like?
- Does your world show itself explicitly, or does it invite interaction to reveal itself over time?
- Is your world a place where people can stay for a while, or is it designed to be experienced quickly?
- What physical hardware will you need to experience your world?

**Project-Specific Focus:**
- **Games or VR:** Focus on the environment
- **AR Experience:** Design anchors and digital assets, possibly map out specific locations (for location-based AR)
- **Film:** Scout locations, frame shots, create storyboards
- **TouchDesigner:** Create preliminary components that will be seen, heard, felt, smelled, or otherwise sensed by your audience
- **Projection Mapping or Installation:** Build or design your set and set pieces

**Resources to Leverage:**
- Singh Sandbox maker space (CNC Routing, 3D printing, carpentry)
- Hardware and equipment available for your project type

### Narrative Structures

This is where you design how your story will be told. From a simple repeating rhythm, to a complex network of story loops, you have many options.

**Key Questions:**
- Will your story be told by a narrator? Will there be actors?
- What is the perspective of your story? If it is in the first person, who is telling it?
- Will you use classical theatrical elements like the chorus or an aside?
- Will it be poetic?
- If your story should be implicit or subtle, how will you make sure it isn't so subtle that the audience misses it entirely?
- If your story is emergent, what is the structure for the emergence?

**Resources to Leverage:**
- Sound studio, microphones, cameras
- Other tools available for storytelling

### Adding Interactivity

How does your audience interact with your world?

**Key Questions:**
- Do they use a controller, a camera, or perhaps move their body through space or in a specific way?
- Does your world require a specialized controller of your own design?

**Resources to Leverage:**
- World-class Maker Space in Iribe to create your controller
- Available input devices and sensors

### Prototype

In this phase you will bring the elements together to create a functional, stable prototype. Your prototype should be robust enough for us and yourselves to understand the functionality, purpose, and experience of your project.

**Prototype Options:**
- Robust "vertical slice" (one complete section)
- Whole wide world (complete but smaller scope)
- Hardware controller with simple software side (to demonstrate the controller)
- One really nice scene (where you will eventually be making many)

This is where you will set your own goal for the prototype with consultation from us.
